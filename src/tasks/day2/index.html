                <p>My learning journey with HTML and CSS has been an exciting experience filled with curiosity and
                    creativity. When
                    I first started, I knew very little about how websites were built. The idea that I could design and
                    structure a
                    webpage from scratch fascinated me, and that curiosity became the motivation to begin. HTML was my
                    starting point. I learned that it is the backbone of every webpage, giving structure to content.
                    Tags like headings, paragraphs, images, and links helped me understand how a simple document could
                    transform
                    into a basic website. It was amazing to see how a few lines of code could display meaningful content
                    on the
                    browser.Next, I moved on to CSS, which added style and beauty to the plain HTML structure. CSS
                    taught me how to use
                    colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing to make a webpage look professional and attractive. I enjoyed
                    experimenting
                    with different designs and gradually started understanding the importance of responsiveness and
                    user-friendly
                    layouts. This journey has boosted my confidence in web development. Each day I practice, I get
                    closer to creating real
                    websites. Learning HTML and CSS has laid a strong foundation for my future in coding and design.</p>
