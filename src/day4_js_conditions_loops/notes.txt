                                            --- Conditional statement ---

# if
   Use if to specify a code block to be executed, if a specified condition is true

# if else
   Use if to specify a code block to be executed, if a specified condition is true
   Use else to specify a code block to be executed, if the same condition is false

# else if
   Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

# switch
   Use switch to specify many alternative code blocks to be executed



                                                 --- Loop statement ---


# for
  The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:

  for (expr1; expr2; expr) {
  // code block to be executed
  }

  exp1 is executed one time before the execution of the code block.
  exp2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
  exp3 is executed every time the code block has been executed.

# while
  he while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

  while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
  }


# do while
  The do while loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true,
  then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

  do {
  // code block to be executed
  }
  while (condition);
